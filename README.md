# Thanks for taking the time to review my project!

I used Python to write the logic for this project. 
My main goals for this project was to store the data memory efficiently and keep O(n) costs to a minimum.
The area of most concern was an efficient sorting procedure for desc drug prices and asc name.

There is still some work to do by adding another testing suite and refactoring the pharmacycounting.py file.

I had a great time working on this project.  Thank you for your consideration.
